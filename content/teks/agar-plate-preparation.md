# Agar Plate Preparation and Storage

Agar plates are the foundation of advanced mushroom cultivation, allowing for tissue culture, spore isolation, and contamination detection. This technique will teach you to prepare professional-quality plates using basic equipment.

## What You'll Need

### Base Ingredients
- **Agar powder**: 20g (2% concentration)
- **Malt extract**: 20g OR potato dextrose: 24g
- **Distilled water**: 1000ml (1 liter)

### Equipment
- **Petri dishes**: 50-100 plastic disposable dishes
- **Pressure cooker**: For sterilization
- **Measuring tools**: Digital scale, graduated cylinder
- **Mixing**: Large glass beaker or flask
- **Sterile workspace**: Still air box or flow hood

### Optional Additives
- **Activated charcoal**: 2g (for spore isolation)
- **Antibiotics**: Gentamicin or streptomycin (advanced use)

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Workspace Preparation

Create the cleanest possible environment:
- Clean all surfaces with 70% isopropyl alcohol
- Wipe down all equipment and containers
- If using a still air box, allow 30 minutes for air to settle
- Have all materials within easy reach

### 2. Measuring and Mixing

**Dry Mix Method** (Recommended for beginners):
1. Measure 20g agar powder into clean container
2. Add 20g malt extract (or 24g potato dextrose)
3. Gradually add 100ml distilled water while stirring
4. Continue stirring until smooth paste forms
5. Slowly add remaining 900ml water while mixing

**Critical point**: Avoid lumps at this stage – they're difficult to dissolve later.

### 3. Dissolution Process

Heat the mixture while stirring constantly:
- Use medium heat to avoid scorching
- Stir continuously to prevent agar from settling
- Heat until mixture reaches rolling boil
- Continue boiling for 2-3 minutes until completely clear
- Remove from heat immediately when clear

### 4. pH Testing and Adjustment

Test pH using strips or meter. Target pH: 5.5-6.5 for most mushroom species.

**Adjustment guidelines**:
- **Too acidic**: Add small amounts of calcium carbonate
- **Too alkaline**: Add citric acid crystals (tiny amounts)

### 5. Sterilization

**Pressure Cooker Method**:
- Pour hot agar into sterilizable container with loose lid
- Process at 15 PSI for 20 minutes
- Allow natural pressure release

**Important**: Don't over-sterilize agar – it can break down and lose gelling properties.

### 6. Plate Pouring

This is the most critical step requiring sterile technique:

1. **Cool agar to 50-60°C** (hot but not scalding to touch)
2. **Work quickly but carefully** in sterile environment
3. **Pour plates one at a time**:
   - Slightly open petri dish lid
   - Pour 15-20ml agar per plate
   - Close lid immediately
   - Gently swirl to distribute evenly

**Pro tip**: Pour in assembly-line fashion – set up 10-15 plates, pour all quickly, then move to next batch.

### 7. Cooling and Quality Check

Allow plates to cool at room temperature for 1-2 hours:
- **Proper consistency**: Firm gel that doesn't move when tilted
- **Surface quality**: Smooth, bubble-free surface
- **Color**: Clear to slightly amber (depending on nutrients used)

**Quality indicators**:
- No condensation on lid
- Uniform thickness across plate
- Clean, sharp edges where agar meets dish

## Storage and Handling

### Short-term Storage (1-2 weeks)
- Store plates right-side up in clean container
- Keep at room temperature away from direct light
- Check daily for contamination signs

### Long-term Storage (1-2 months)
- Wrap plates individually in parafilm or plastic wrap
- Store in refrigerator at 4°C (39°F)
- Allow to reach room temperature before use

## Pro Tips & Troubleshooting

### Common Problems and Solutions

**Problem**: Cloudy or lumpy agar
**Solution**: Insufficient mixing or overheating. Reheat and strain if necessary.

**Problem**: Agar too soft/won't gel
**Solution**: Insufficient agar concentration or over-sterilization. Add more agar powder.

**Problem**: Excessive condensation
**Solution**: Pour at proper temperature (50-60°C) and ensure proper cooling.

**Problem**: Contamination in multiple plates
**Solution**: Sterile technique breakdown. Review workspace cleanliness and pouring method.

### Advanced Techniques

**Charcoal Plates**: Add 2g activated charcoal for isolating mushroom cultures from contaminated samples. The charcoal absorbs inhibitory compounds.

**Selective Media**: Add antibiotics to suppress bacterial growth when working with wild samples or contamination-prone cultures.

**Test Plates**: Always pour 2-3 extra plates and leave them exposed during work session to test for environmental contamination.

## Applications

### Spore Germination
Use fresh plates with standard MEA (Malt Extract Agar) for germinating spores from prints or syringes.

### Tissue Culture
Isolate mushroom tissue from fresh specimens to create pure cultures for propagation.

### Contamination Testing
Test substrate samples, spawn, or environmental samples for unwanted microorganisms.

### Culture Maintenance
Store and maintain pure mushroom cultures for long-term use and genetic preservation.

Mastering agar preparation opens up advanced cultivation techniques and gives you complete control over your mushroom genetics. Start with simple MEA plates and gradually experiment with specialized formulations as your skills develop!
